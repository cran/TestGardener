Description: Develop, evaluate, and score multiple choice examinations, 
    psychological scales, questionnaires, and similar types of data involving
    sequences of choices among one or more sets of answers.
    Using the package does not require any formal statistical knowledge 
    beyond what would be provided by a first course in statistics in a 
    social science department.  There the user would encounter the concept 
    of probability and how it is used to model data and make decisions, 
    and would become familiar with basic mathematical and statistical notation.
    The essential aspects of each display were designed to be self-explanatory, 
    although more statistically sophisticated users will also find information 
    that they may find helpful. Most of the output is in graphical form. Two
    recent papers on the methodology are
